# Nano-GPT
This repository implements a character-level language model using a Transformer Decoder-only architecture. The model generates text one character at a time, inspired by the transformer architecture described in the original Attention is All You Need paper.

# Features
Character-Level Language Modeling: Each character in the text corpus is treated as a token.
Transformer Decoder: A stack of multi-head self-attention blocks and feed-forward layers.
Residual Connections: Ensures better gradient flow during training.
Customizable Hyperparameters: Includes context length, embedding size, number of heads, layers, and dropout rate.
Efficient Sampling: Generates new text using the trained model with softmax probabilities and multinomial sampling.

# Architecture
The model is implemented as a Transformer Decoder with the following components:

# Embedding Layers:

Token Embeddings: Maps each character in the vocabulary to a dense vector.
Positional Embeddings: Adds positional information to the token embeddings to preserve order.

# Transformer Block:

Multi-Head Self-Attention: Allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence.
Feed-Forward Network: A fully connected layer to process the attention outputs.
Residual Connections: Adds the original input back to the output of attention/feed-forward layers.
Layer Normalization: Normalizes inputs to stabilize training.

# Final Linear Layer:

Maps the output embeddings back to the vocabulary size to predict the next character.

# Training
## Key Hyperparameters
Batch Size: 32
Context Length: 256
Embedding Dimension: 384
Number of Heads: 6
Number of Layers: 6
Dropout: 0.2
Learning Rate: 3e-4
Optimizer: AdamW

# Results
Training Loss: Converges over several iterations to a low value, indicating the model is learning patterns in the data.
Generated Text: Produces coherent text based on the training data at the character level.

# Future Improvements
Larger Contexts: Experiment with longer context lengths for better coherence.
Scaling Up: Increase model capacity (layers, heads, embedding size) for more complex datasets.
Larger Model Size:
Increase the model's capacity by using a higher number of layers, heads, or embedding dimensions. This will allow the model to learn more complex patterns and generate higher-quality text.
Different Tokenization Schemes:
Instead of character-level tokenization, use subword or word-level tokenization for better efficiency and language understanding. Implement tokenization using libraries such as:
Hugging Face Tokenizers
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
